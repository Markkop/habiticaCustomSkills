# habiticaCustomSkills

## Motivation

I've already used **Habitica** once and just started using it again to organize myself. However, I've been so focused that I quickly **outleveled my friends** and wondered how could I adjust my leveling process so I could keep up with the party.  
That's how this project begins. By **consuming experience points** while using skills, I could slow down my leveling in exchange for other resources such hp, mana and gold. The challenging part here is to balance them correctly so these custom skills don't become too overpowered.  
With this project I've been able to practice **Javascript, HTML, CSS, Testing and Functional Programming skills**.

## How to Use

Install [Violentmonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) / [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)  
Click on its icon and `New user script`  
Copy the content of [build/customSkills.user.js](build/customSkills.user.js) and paste it  
Change `userid` in the **tokens** function for your User Id _(eg. 50387371-92ee-...)_  
Change `tokenapi` for your [Token Api](https://habitica.com/user/settings/api) _(eg. cfd2a65e-a8bc-....)_  
Reload your [Habitica](https://habitica.com/)'s home
