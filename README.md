## Status

This script was my first javascript project and I've learned A LOT since then. It's been broken for a while and I decided to refactor it with my new learnings and with a different strategy: instead of creating all html elements by hand, I'm now cloning them from existing ones and changing the values I need.

## Motivation

I've already used **Habitica** once and just started using it again to organize myself. However, I've been so focused that I quickly **outleveled my friends** and wondered how could I adjust my leveling process so I could keep up with the party.  
That's how this project begins. By **consuming experience points** while using skills, I could slow down my leveling in exchange for other resources such hp, mana and gold. The challenging part here is to balance them correctly so these custom skills don't become too overpowered.  
With this project I've been able to practice **Javascript, HTML, CSS, Testing and Functional Programming skills**.
